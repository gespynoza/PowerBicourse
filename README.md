As teacher of the data analysis technical course at a non-profit organization focused on digital gender gap, I was responsible for the creation of course content and methodology, as well as the selection of relevant topics and examples. I taught students how to use relational databases through the SQL structured query language and how to develop dashboards in Power BI. My efforts were met with a high rate of approval, and my students were extremely satisfied with the course. I am proud of the positive impact I made in this role and am confident in my ability to teach and inspire others
